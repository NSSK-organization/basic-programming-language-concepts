		<h1>The Basics of NikoScript</h1>

		<p>
		In NikoScript, there are some syntax rules that need to be followed.
		</p>

		<p>
		Since a computer cannot read like a human, we define a <b>grammar</b> for NikoScript. Grammar has simple rules -- I'm not going to get into much detail here (you can eventually learn about compilers if you find this interesting), but the grammar rules follow procedure similar to C.</p>

		<h2>Grammar Rules</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Every single statement must have a semicolon character (;) at the end of it (like we have periods at the end of our sentences).</li>
			<li>All statements in Nikoscript must have some meaning or purpose. While other programming languages may allow you to do this, it's generally not a good idea, unless you are trying to make yourself unhirable.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
		The majority of this course is build based off of debugging skills; I will give you faulty code, and you will debug it. Occasionally, you may write some code of your own, as it is always good practice to do so.
