  <p>In NikoScript, variables are <b>hard-typed</b>, which means you need to specify the type of values you want.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Here are some examples of values, along with some examples of what they are exactly.</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>Type Name</td>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>Examples</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> <!-- int -->
      <td>int</td>
      <td>An integer. No decimals or fractions permitted. By default, integers are <b>signed</b>, which means that they can be positive or negative. Memory is layed out in bits and bytes. 1 bit can either be a one or zero, and a byte is eight bits. An int (signed or unsigned) is four bytes in most languages, including NikoScript, allowing for a total of 2 raised to the thirty-second power, or about 4.2 million different values. A signed int, or simply int, ranges from about -2.1 to 2.1 million.</td>
      <td>1, -3, 24567, -234102</td>
    </tr>

      if(tokenAmount == rightValue) {
        alert("You got it!");
        return true;
      }
      alert("Close, but not quite!");
      return false;
    }
