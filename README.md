# Learn the basics of OOP!

Learn the basics of Object-oriented programming in the way everyone knows and loves -- I have created a fake programming language, called NikoScript, which will be similar in style to Java and C++.

In this course, we will learn the following:

* Syntax basics
* Variables and hard-typing
* Functions (Coming Soon!)
* Classes (Coming Soon!)
* Methods: The Constructor and Destructor (Coming Soon!)
* Inheritance (Coming Soon!)
* Composition (Coming Soon!)

###### Actually, I have never done web development before, so I am learning as I go along. Maybe this can be a learning experience for both of us!
